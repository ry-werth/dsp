[Think Stats Chapter 3 Exercise 1](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2004.html#toc31) (actual vs. biased)

Actual mean 1.024205155043831
Observed mean 2.403679100664282

We can see the observed mean of kids under 18 in a household is well higher than the actual mean. This is because almost 50% of the households had 0 kids under the age of 18 in the house, and none of those houses would be reflected in the observed mean.
